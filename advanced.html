        <h3>Building Complex Web Applications</h3>
        <p>
          I'd like to announce that we'll be re-offering the advanced web development class I'm calling "Building Complex Web Applications" this spring from Aug 13-15 (this time in Hanover NH).  
        </p>
        <p>
          The course will be similar to the introduction to web development course that we've put on in the past but will cover more advanced topics related to client-side development.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Some of the concepts / frameworks that we'll cover are listed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>ES2015 concepts (latest version of JavaScript) and beyond</li>
          <li>Transpiling client-side code using tools like webpack</li>
          <li>Building user interfaces using components in React</li>
          <li>Using Node.js and NPM for development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Attendees should be familiar with the basics of web development and have some JavaScript experience.  If you're interested, but aren't sure if you're ready for the advanced class, we'll be doing the introduction class later this year, keep an eye open for that announcement.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no tuition for the course, but attendees will be responsible for paying for their labor and travel to the course location, if you have a couple people where you sit that would be interested this is your chance to lobby for hosting the course at your location and save the travel funding.  We would just need a room that could accommodate 10-15 people and their laptops.  
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any questions or would like more details, please just let me know.
